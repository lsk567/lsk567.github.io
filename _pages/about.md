Welcome! I am an EECS PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Professor [Edward
Lee](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/~eal/) and Professor [Sanjit Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/).
I am very much interested in building trust-worthy and reliable cyber-physical systems (CPS). I am
also broadly interested in blockchain and quantum computing.

To learn about my work, you can either read the [papers](/papers) or check out my [portfolio](/portfolio), where I provide the TLDRs of the papers. 

I am also interested in entrepreneurship and have worked for a couple of startups in the past. To learn more about my experiences in general, feel free to check out my [CV](/files/Shaokai_Lin_CV.pdf). I believe in producing high-quality work in everything I do.
