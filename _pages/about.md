Welcome! I am an EECS PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Professor [Edward
Lee](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/~eal/) and Professor [Sanjit Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/).
I am very much interested in building trust-worthy and reliable cyber-physical systems (CPS). I am
also broadly interested in blockchain and quantum computing.

I am currently working on designing and verifying reactor systems written in [Lingua Franca](https://github.com/icyphy/lingua-franca)
by leveraging symbolic techniques that the [UCLID5](https://github.com/uclid-org/uclid) engine provides.

My past research projects also include: 
- [<i>Scivik</i>](/portfolio/scivik), a formal verification toolchain for Ethereum smart contracts, 
- [<i>CArmor</i>](/portfolio/carmor), a C compiler extension that produces program partitions for network enclaves,
- [<i>CQSD</i>](/portfolio/cqsd), an efficiency-oriented secure quantum communication protocol,
- [<i>Serverlessnet</i>](/portfolio/serverlessnet), a serverless-enabled IoT network prototyping software.

I am also interested in entrepreneurship and have worked for a couple of startups in the past. To learn more about my experiences, please check out my [CV](/files/Shaokai_Lin_CV.pdf) and [portfolio](/portfolio). I believe in producing high-quality work in everything I do.
