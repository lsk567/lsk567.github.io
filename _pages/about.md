Welcome to my homepage. I am an EECS PhD student at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Professor Edward Lee
and Professor Sanjit Seshia. My main interest lies in leveraging formal methods to verify cyber-physical systems. I am
also broadly interested in the Internet of Things (IoT), security, blockchain, and quantum computing.

Here is a list of my past research projects: 
- [<i>Scivik</i>](/portfolio/4-scivik), a formal verification toolchain for Ethereum smart contracts, 
- [<i>CArmor</i>](/portfolio/3-carmor), a C compiler extension that produces program partitions for network enclaves,
- [<i>CQSD</i>](/portfolio/2-cqsd), an efficiency-oriented secure quantum communication protocol,
- [<i>Serverlessnet</i>](/portfolio/1-serverlessnet), a serverless-enabled IoT network prototyping software.

I am also interested in entreprenuership and have worked for a couple startups in the past. To learn more about my experiences, please check out my [CV](/files/Shaokai_Lin_CV.pdf) and [portfolio](/portfolio). I believe in producing high-quality work in everything I do.
