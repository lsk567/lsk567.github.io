Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a undergraduate student at Columbia University studying computer science. I am interested in the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, formal verification, security, blockchain, and quantum computing.

My research projects include 
1. [<i>Serverlessnet</i>](https://serverlessnet.github.io/serverlessnet), a serverless-enabled IoT network prototyping software,
2. <i>Scivik</i>, a formal verification toolchain for Ethereum smart contracts, 
3. <i>CArmor</i>, a C compiler extension that produces program partitions for network enclaves,
4. <i>CQSD</i>, an efficiency-oriented secure quantum communication protocol, accepted to be presented in a poster session at QIP2020.

I am also highly interested in entreprenuership and have launched a couple startups in the past. To learn more about my experiences, please check out my [portfolio](/portfolio). I believe in prioritizing the quality of work instead of quantity. I look up to academic and tech giants including Professor Shoucheng Zhang, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk.
