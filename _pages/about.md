Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a undergraduate student at Columbia University studying computer science. I am interested in the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, formal verification, security, blockchain, and quantum computing.

My research projects include 
1. [<i>Serverlessnet</i>](/portfolio/1-serverlessnet), a serverless-enabled IoT network prototyping software,
2. [<i>Scivik</i>](/portfolio/2-scivik), a formal verification toolchain for Ethereum smart contracts, 
3. [<i>CArmor</i>](/portfolio/3-carmor), a C compiler extension that produces program partitions for network enclaves,
4. [<i>CQSD</i>](/portfolio/4-cqsd), an efficiency-oriented secure quantum communication protocol, accepted to be presented in a poster session at QIP2020.

I am also interested in entreprenuership and have worked for a couple startups in the past. To learn more about my experiences, please check out my [CV](/files/Shaokai_Lin_CV.pdf) and [portfolio](/portfolio). I believe in producing high-quality work in everything I do.
