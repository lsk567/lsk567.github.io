excerpt: 'With the emergence of quantum computing and quantum networks, many communication protocols that take advantage of the unique properties of quantum mechanics to achieve a secure bidirectional exchange of information, have been proposed. In this study, we propose a new quantum communication protocol, called Continuous Quantum Secure Dialogue (CQSD), that allows two parties to continuously exchange messages without halting while ensuring the privacy of the conversation. Compared to existing protocols, CQSD improves the efficiency of quantum communication. In addition, we offer an implementation of the CQSD protocol using the Qiskit framework. Finally, we conduct a security analysis of the CQSD protocol in the context of several common forms of attack.'
